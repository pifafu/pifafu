    :wave: Hi! I design for <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>.
    <br>Before that, I designed at GitHub for 6+ years!
      <br>I think GitHub is <em>so cool</em> and still use it :D
    <br>Today, I'm still learning to make things :sparkles:<br><br>

   I forgot to write down a goal last year! I'll commit to something and set a goal for 2023: learn about and design for governance — try to make web3 easier to use and understand.

  ✨ <strong><a href="https://prettygood.club/">I DID IT!</a></strong> ✨ I <i>finally</i> focused on a body of work in pottery. I'm damn proud. Going to keep it up, but slowly. :)<br><br>
  <i>I didn't complete my 2020 goal, but it was a crazy different year 😂 In 2021, I want to finally have a portfolio site and make an online storefront for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/prettygoodclub/" target="_blank">pottery</a>. Here's to new aspirations and forgiving yourself for not finishing every goal you set for yourself for the new year.</i>

  I want to make a little game this year.<br>I'm currently working on a small gameboy game with <a href="https://github.com/tfgrimes">@tfgrimes</a> using <a href="https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio" target="_blank">GBStudio.dev</a>, which is an awesome game creator tool that makes it really easy to design a game if you're primarily focusing on the art and story (like myself). I'm hoping to print this on a cartridge when I'm done so you can actually experience it on a Gameboy!
